## How it works

A current comparator that compares 2 currents each formed by a sum of 8 digital pins.

## How to test

Set the 8 inputs to form current A and 8 bi-directional inputs to form current B.
The ouptut analog voltage is the result of the comparison operator (sigmoid).

## External hardware

A multimeter to measure the output voltage on analog pin 0.
